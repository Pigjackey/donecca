The secret is that I'm not okay. Not at all. My heart is aching more than I can express. I just can't bear to talk to people today.

Sorry for making today's entry so sad but I figure that not every day can be joyful\\. There is truly opposition in all things\\. I am trying to grow from this\\. I want to be a better man\\. I just want to hug you so bad\\. I want to be able to cry on your lap\\. I just want to feel okay\\. But God will help me just like he's helping you\\. Thank you for being with me, Becca\\. You are my best friend, even when you aren't here with me right now\\. I love you\\. Please be well\\. I miss you so much",

      "text" : "Today was a complete roller coaster\\. There were a lot of good things and a lot of bad things\\. At first I was having a really hard day and I wasn't able to focus on work very well at all\\. In fact I had to put on podcasts all day long because it made me feel less alone\\. I was able to get a decent amount of work done though, and my bosses seemed happy with it\\. I got invited to a fancy meeting later in the day with some of the people that are supposed to be using the pages that we're writing at work\\. I was able to show them through the things that I've been working on and receive not only their praise but the praise of my boss Marty and Spencer as well\\. It felt really good to get that recognition of all the hard work that I've put into this project\\. I was going to make myself something healthy for dinner but I couldn't help but eat a few slices of the pizza that my dad brought home so rip that\\. It's just really hard to work up the motivation to cook healthy food right now\\. I definitely miss having you cook such delicious food for me all the time haha\\. The day got even better though when I saw an email hit my phone in the evening\\. It was from Juni Learning and you guessed it I got a job offer\\! I am so happy about that\\. I'll be able to work extra hours and make enough money to cover myself as I move into the fall\\. I'll be able to buy a car and I won't have to worry too much about running out of money\\. I was also talking to my grandma yesterday and she said that the money in the fund is still available for me to use when I need it\\. So those things at the end of the day were nice and I really appreciated them\\. You know I do miss you a whole lot though\\. I think about you all the time\\. Today I had the scary thought that I can't stay the same that I am right now\\. I think in the back of my mind that was what I was planning on doing but I realized that you are going to be changing a whole lot during your mission\\. I have the opportunity to grow too and become a better man than I am today\\. I am painfully aware of so many weaknesses that I have and I am going to try to fix some of them while you are away\\. I hope that all of this is worth it and that one day you can come home and we can hug and everything can go back to the wonderful life that it was\\. But I know that I can have a wonderful life while you're gone too\\. it's hard to realize that right now but it's something that I'm working on everyday\\. Honestly sometimes I want to just give up but I realize that you're out there and I remember that you would want me to get up and to try and to do my best and that helps me to push forward\\. You are my best friend and my biggest supporter\\. I love you more than I can say\\. Please be well and know that I am missing you but I'm coping with life\\. also using my voice to dictate these words is not as nice as writing it myself\\. Anyway please sleep well\\. I miss you\\.",

I think about how much fun it'll be to do activities with you in the future :). I also made a big push today to start working on the website. I made so much progress! The page is actually taking some shape and I am very very happy about it! I'm going to work so hard to get it looking perfect for when you get home! It feels really good to devote myself to a task, whatever that might be. If it happens to be making something for you, then all the better. I think that getting out of my own head is the most beneficial thing for me :). Also, my custom journal finally came today! It only took like a month! But it's super super cute and I'm very excited to start copying all of my letters into it. There's quite the backlog but it is most certainly a labor of love if I've ever had one. I really love you!

Today was a good day. I feel much better than I did yesterday. I guess I'm just topsytervy sometimes. I'm not sure you're supposed to write that out haha. Today I was reading in my mission journal about when I had just barely gotten to my first area and met my trainer. I was writing about how it was so cool and how excited I was, but I also wrote about the crippling fear and anxiety that I was having. Because let's face it, I'm terrible at dealing with change :). I was then, and I'm still not that great at it. But back then I managed to work it out! After the first three months or so I had most of the fear taken care of. Right now as you're gone, I'm facing a lot of the same struggles. I'm afraid and anxious. But I know I'll be alright. The presence of those feelings is not an indication of something being wrong, just that I'm growing out of my shell. I'm working on becoming a beautiful butterfly! But no matter what I'll never be as beautiful as you ;P. My heart goes out to you, my love. I long to be with you. But until that day I will live my best life and never give up.

Today I was reading in my mission journal about when I had just barely gotten to my first area and met my trainer\\. I was writing about how it was so cool and how excited I was, but I also wrote about the crippling fear and anxiety that I was having\\. Because let's face it, I'm terrible at dealing with change :\\)\\. I was then, and I'm still not that great at it\\. But back then I managed to work it out\\! After the first three months or so I had most of the fear taken care of\\. Right now as you're gone, I'm facing a lot of the same struggles\\. I'm afraid and anxious\\. But I know I'll be alright\\. The presence of those feelings is not an indication of something being wrong, just that I'm growing out of my shell\\. I'm working on becoming a beautiful butterfly\\! But no matter what I'll never be as beautiful as you ;P\\. My heart goes out to you, my love\\. I long to be with you\\. But until that day I will live my best life and never give up\\. I will be ready for your return\\. Sleep well, Becca\\. I miss you :\\)\\.",

I also taught my second Juni lesson today to a boy named Abdulsalam\\! It was really fun and I loved it\\! I wish I could tell you all about him\\! I just looked up at the sticky notes I have from you and they made me really happy\\. You make me happy, dear\\. I am loving my life right now but I sure do miss living life with you\\! Be safe out there\\! I miss you 😘",

I had about eight hours at BYU and then I had four Juni Learning lessons to teach because they all got rescheduled while I was dead haha\\. So it turned out that I was going to work from 8:00am to 4:00 pm and then from 5:00pm to 9:00pm\\. It was kind of rough, let me tell ya haha\\. But I made it through and I have a smile on my face\\! I absolutely loved getting your voice memos today and they were a great stress relief in the middle of the day\\! I loved hearing your voice so much that when I finished up my last Juni lesson I put my headphones back in and listened to your audio tapes to calm me down and help me release some stress\\. It was wonderful :\\)\\. You make me so happy\\. I love you so much\\. Becca, you are the woman that I want to marry\\. You are the most exceptional person I’ve ever known and you make me a better person\\! Whenever I see your smiling face I can’t help but feel a rush of joy all throughout my body\\.

I must have read 300\\+ pages of Harry Potter today and luckily for me I’ve gotten to the books where Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione and Remus and Tonks and all of these other couples are finding love even in all of their hardship\\. I’m not going to lie, reading about people putting their arms around girls to comfort them or descriptions of boys losing their breath when they see the girls they like kind of got to me haha\\. I still feel that same way about you and I dearly miss having you in my life\\. I long for the day when I can once again hold you in my arms and treat you with the love and respect that you so deserve\\. I will never stop losing *my* breath every time I see *you* looking back at *me\\.* You’re simply the girl for me\\! And I love you to bits\\. Robala sentle, lorato wami\\. I miss you\\!",

You became such a huge part of my life here that I’m not sure I know how to do it without you anymore. It’s going to be an adjustment for sure.

Whenever I see that Y after a while it excites me\\. It’s almost like coming back home\\. But this time around the excitement was missed with a sudden sadness that I wasn’t expecting\\. Because it was at that moment that I realized I was going back to BYU without you\\. It just feels wrong\\! You became such a huge part of my life here that I’m not sure I know how to do it without you anymore\\. It’s going to be an adjustment for sure\\. I got to explain out situation to another mission buddy today\\. It makes me happy to think about it\\. I’m happy that we both have this chance to grow, even though it’s really difficult for me to deal with sometimes\\. Come back soon, my love\\! Sleep well, I miss you\\.",

I listened to a talk given to the women of the church today. I just love hearing about how special you guys are. (It’s funny that I used the word guys to describe women lol). But it’s true! You really are the best. I am so grateful for the women in my life. And since I don’t have you around I’ve felt the difference. I am so glad that I don’t have to spend eternity alone. I don’t think they’d be any point to that at all. I’d be infinitely more happy with you by my side. Figuring everything out together forever. That’s the dream! You’re my dream. I love you to bits! Stay safe, my love. I miss you.\"}]}",

It was so nice\\! I really really like working out\\. It’s hard to motivate myself sometimes but I always feel better afterwards\\. I am super focused right now on getting my body to peak condition\\. I want to keep getting stronger and eat the right mix of foods to keep my body working nice nice nice\\. I am once again so grateful that you helped me to realize how important taking care of myself is\\! You’re going to live a long and full life and I want to be right there next to you the whole way :\\)\\. When I think about the potential we have for the future and all the things we’ll be able to do it’s almost too much for me\\! I can’t believe I have a blessing in my life as amazing as you\\. Thank you for being part of my life\\! Thank you for always caring for me\\. I love you so much\\! Please sleep well\\! I miss you\\.",

And unlike with Lundqvist, I’ll never have to say goodbye to you :). I sure do love you, Becca! I want to spend eternity with you. That sounds like the most wonderful thing I can imagine! Please sleep well :). I miss you!\"}]}",

At one point you were talking about the semester you’ll have right after getting back and how busy you’ll be with your classes and planning a wedding and you were a little bit stressed about it haha\\. I’ll probably tell you next week in my email but don’t you worry one bit\\! We’ll figure it out together and if you’re too busy then I’ll do all of the hard work of planning the wedding\\. I have a pretty good idea of what you want at this point, after all :\\)\\. I just want you to know how much I care\\!

If you came over we could sit on my couches but they aren’t very good cuddle couches so I might want to figure something else out ;p\\. I know you think I’m a little bit crazy but the only thing I value in a couch is how comfortable you can be cuddling in it 🤷‍♂️\\. Hey, when you read this, I want you to do something for me\\. I want you to come get me, or call me, and tell me that I said the word buttercup\\. I’ll know what I mean\\! And then if I’m there you should cuddle me\\. I’m sure I’m in the mood for it ;p\\. I love you, Becca\\! Please be well\\! And I’ll see you soon\\. I miss you\\!",

You got to go through the temple! Oh how I can’t wait to hear about your experience! And when you get home I’m going to take you to the temple on our first date and it’s going to be magnificent! I am very very excited for that. Today in my gratitude journal I wrote about the absence of a blessing and I chose to write about what my life would have been like without you. I would be so far and away from where I am now! You have helped and inspired me to greater heights than I knew were possible! As I thought about how much better prepared for marriage both of us will be when you get back, it made me so excited for that day! I cannot wait to marry you! We have a long life of joy to experience together, my love. Come home soon so we can start it :). I love you! And I miss you.\"}]}"

I love you so much and talking to you today was so much fun! I really love the chance I have every week to refresh our relationship. Today was a good conversation! I feel like that every week, though ;p. Even though we’re apart I feel like we’re building our relationship a little bit every week and it makes me happy :). You’re the girl for me! Today you said that you can’t imagine what it will be like to be engaged and how that will be possible in December of next year. Isn’t that crazy? I’m not going to lie, I’ve thought about proposing to you quite a few times. I don’t know exactly how I want to do it but I think it being right around Christmas time sounds just perfect :). The only problem is that I won’t be able to come see you until a week or so before Christmas under the best circumstances so we’ll want to make sure that’s what we want to do, too. But I’m sure it will all work out just fine :). And I’m not going to tell you about my proposal plans so that you can be extra super surprised. But I’m pretty smooth so look forward to it ;p. I love you Becca! And I love you more and more every day. Be safe for me. I miss you.\"}]}"

I tried to keep her laughing and we talked about our missions and covid and her boy and you\\. I told her the full story about when I first saw you in sacrament meeting and how we met and she kept going ‘awww’\\. Not gonna lie, telling girls about you is my favorite thing because they always thing it’s the cutest thing and they always go ‘awwwww’ haha\\. I think it’s similar to how girls will always cover their mouth with their hands when they get proposed to\\. You just can’t help yourself ;p\\. I ended up walking down to the temple and back and when Rachael found out she was like ‘are you too cold? Do I need to let you go so you can get warm??’\\.

And just to preface the whole thing so you don’t worry, I did *not* ask for any of this haha\\. Jack Funk and I were walking through the mall today and this lady at a kiosk type place came over and tried to sell me her products\\. They were those jelly looking things that get hot really fast in place of like a rice pack\\. I’m literally sitting here laughing to myself right now because the whole situation was so weird haha\\. She was really close to me and kept saying all of these flirtatious things and I was just waiting for an opportunity to speak so that I could get away from there\\. But then she grabs the shoulder one, puts it on my neck, and starts massaging me\\! Like right in the middle of the mall while I’m standing there\\.

Becca I can’t express how much it means to me to have you in my life. You love me more than I knew someone could. And I love you more than I knew I could. It’s literally just the most perfect thing and I can’t believe that God was gracious enough to let me near you. You are the best blessing that I’ve ever received :). I love you so much! Please please please stay safe for me so that one day you can come home to my arms. I miss you!\"}]}",

But it was really funny because I was telling her that she wasn’t a bad person and all of these things and she said it’s funny that she gets that kind of advice from her sister’s boyfriend.

I also have to tell Collin in a few minutes that he can and maybe should take another shot at Lacey here because she’s low-key into him. I don’t know how I end up in these rolls of helping other people’s relationships but I think it’s fun. But I won’t lie I really miss being able to put all of that effort into our relationship!

The first is a silly story haha. Lacey sent a picture of a guy’s mutual bio on our group chat and he had this as his bio “If your mom isn’t hot then swipe down”. Isn’t that terrible? It made me mad so I decided to find him. This was the information that I had from that page. His name is Stephen, he served in three missions, and he was from Nashville. It took a good while to find him but I did! And then I found his dad. And then I messaged his dad telling him that his son’s actions had been offensive. Did I go way overboard? Probably haha. But I just hate when guys are rude or disrespectful of women and I won’t stand for it. Objectification is wrong and it hurts people! So anyway that was the first thing. The second thing is that my roommate Mike came into my room tonight to talk to me. I listen to him and we’re able to have pretty solid conversations a lot of the time. He was telling me all of the reasons that he loves his relationship and I was telling him that I was really happy for him and that I liked being around the two of them because I can tell that they have a healthy relationship. He stopped, looked me in the eye, and said “You’re a really good guy, Donovon”. He said that a lot of people talk the talk but that he can tell that I walk the walk. It was a huge compliment and I’m honored. I try very hard to be a good man. And I fall short. But it’s good to know that I succeed sometimes, too. He said he can tell that we’re really in love and that made me really happy too. I love when people are actually interested in hearing about you because I love talking about you! I will tell people about all of the little things that you do that just blow me away and how grateful I am to have you in my life. I really really love you, Becca.

It was a little thing and it was just there in the moment but I remember talking about it afterwards and we both thought it was pretty cute :). But you really are my favorite! And the most dear thing in my heart. Today I got to go hang out with Ririe and Carlee and some of their family and friends. We played Secret Hitler and I adamantly declared each and every round that I was Hitler. I wasn’t the first two times but the third time I actually was and nobody believed me when I said it. It was pretty funny and I won all three rounds haha. It brought me back to the somewhat awkward but also super fun time that we went to game night with the two of them. It was loads of fun enjoying that very interesting experience with you right there by my side! I feel like I can take on any challenge if I have you there with me.

What’s going on? Probably not a whole lot of things since you do the same thing every day ;p. What’s going on with me, you might ask? Nothing much. I made a ton of money on the stock market again today. There’s this crazy once in a lifetime thing going on where I’m making insane profits because there’s a war between us regular people and rich people on Wall Street. It turns out that we common people can be pretty powerful if we work together :). I’m happy to be a part of something that I believe to be right. I really really miss telling you about all of the silly things I do and having you valify it all. You really are my greatest cheerleader! As I was making all of this money today I kept wanting to tell people and have them be excited for me but it’s just not the same haha. I need my Becca back ;p. I also went on a walk today as asked her more about her depression and how she manages it and whatnot. I think I got some valuable advice on how to cope and be better going forward. Unfortunately it seems like a big part of it is going to be eating a solidly healthy diet and that’s quite a bit of effort. BUT I’M GOING TO DO IT! Thank you for being so supportive towards me in this quest to be mentally healthy. It’s not an easy thing but knowing that you’re there behind me helps a lot. I really love you, you know. And I can’t wait for you to come home. Please be safe. I miss you.\"}]}"

I remember you would swing your arms above mine and I would be able to grasp around your waist and just pull you into myself.

Because it was limited to just one day this week I felt like it was a lot more special when I was able to take that time to spend talking to you :). I’ve said it so many times but I really do feel like I fall in love with you all over again ever week that I get to hear your voice. You are just the most special girl in the world to me and I love you to pieces! Today you talked about how bad you are at socializing and I feeeeeel that! I can’t wait to work on that together when you get home haha. I legit think it’ll be the best thing ever when we are able to make chill friends that we both love spending time with and that we can have healthy friendly relationships with. We’re going to be just fine and I’m so excited for it! You’re the best, Becca. I love you! Robala sentle, I miss you\"}]}"

I just miss being able to talk to you all the time\\! But you know, it’s going really fast and someday soon I’ll get to talk to you in person again\\! I went for a walk with one of my friends today and I had the chance to talk about you for a while\\. I love talking about how special you are how much I love you\\! I use the things that I’ve learned from our communication skills to help other people who don’t quite know how a healthy relationship works\\. I think we’re pretty much the best people ever ;p\\. One day I hope that people like my friend who haven’t seen a lot of healthy relationships in their life will be able to look at us and see how good things can be ;p\\. I love you babe\\!

I am loossssiinnnngggg my mind right now! I just don’t know what the right thing to do is and it’s kind of destroying me haha. But I’m going to figure it out! I just don’t know how yet haha. See here’s what happened though. I went up to a mountain on Monday and I prayed and asked God if I was supposed to leave the job or take it. I felt decently clearly that day that I should not accept the new job. But I still didn’t feel like telling them that immediately. So that led me to today when I finally got around to writing the email that said that I wouldn’t be able to accept the position. But I didn’t feel quite right about sending it either so I got down and prayed and I feel like maybe I should take it. I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO. It might be one of those things that I just have to figure out myself and that’s terrifying. I wish you were here. Even though it’s like 10:30pm right now I’m going to go for a walk to the temple because I need to sort things out. I will get my answers because I need help and God loves me. It might just not be exactly in the way I wished he would help. But I know I’ll grow! Anyway, I just want you to know how important the gospel is to me. I love it. And I love my Savior. I’m so glad that you feel the same way. Good night, Becca. Sleep well. I miss you.\"}]}",

I just don’t know how yet haha\\. See here’s what happened though\\. I went up to a mountain on Monday and I prayed and asked God if I was supposed to leave the job or take it\\. I felt decently clearly that day that I should not accept the new job\\. But I still didn’t feel like telling them that immediately\\. So that led me to today when I finally got around to writing the email that said that I wouldn’t be able to accept the position\\. But I didn’t feel quite right about sending it either so I got down and prayed and I feel like maybe I should take it\\. I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO\\. It might be one of those things that I just have to figure out myself and that’s terrifying\\. I wish you were here\\. Even though it’s like 10:30pm right now I’m going to go for a walk to the temple because I need to sort things out\\. I will get my answers because I need help and God loves me\\. It might just not be exactly in the way I wished he would help\\. But I know I’ll grow\\! Anyway, I just want you to know how important the gospel is to me\\. I love it\\. And I love my Savior\\. I’m so glad that you feel the same way\\. Good night, Becca\\. Sleep well\\. I miss you\\.",

Today has been a pretty hard day for me. But those aren’t ever going to really stop happening, are they? We had President’s Day off yesterday but I still ended up doing a lot of homework yesterday and I had a ton to do today as well. Part of that is because all of my classes are on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and so my homework Tuesday got lumped with everything else I usually have to do on Monday. I’mma be honest, I just wanted to give up today. I was not very happy about everything that was going on and it got kind of overwhelming. It’s just hard when you have one hard, time-consuming task right after another and that goes on all day. It’s like 9:15pm and even though I was busy all day long I still didn’t quite get everything done. Sigh. Life is just hard sometimes. And I wish it didn’t have to be that way. But I’ll be okay. Tomorrow will be a brighter day. I got a text from my bishop today with the information to make the next steps towards getting a therapist. So hopefully I’ll be able to get that done tomorrow. You know, sometimes I imagine all of my pain and stress going away when you get back, but obviously that won’t be the case. I’ll still be in a really hard program and you will be, too, so we’ll have to work really hard just to have time together. But I still do think it’ll be awesome. Because I’ll have a reminder every day of why I’m working so hard and why life is so good. You’re my favorite, Becca. I think about you a lot. And I hope you’re happy and well today.

      "text" : "Hi Becca\\. Today has been a pretty hard day for me\\. But those aren’t ever going to really stop happening, are they? We had President’s Day off yesterday but I still ended up doing a lot of homework yesterday and I had a ton to do today as well\\. Part of that is because all of my classes are on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and so my homework Tuesday got lumped with everything else I usually have to do on Monday\\. I’mma be honest, I just wanted to give up today\\. I was not very happy about everything that was going on and it got kind of overwhelming\\. It’s just hard when you have one hard, time\\-consuming task right after another and that goes on all day\\. It’s like 9:15pm and even though I was busy all day long I still didn’t quite get everything done\\. Sigh\\. Life is just hard sometimes\\. And I wish it didn’t have to be that way\\. But I’ll be okay\\. Tomorrow will be a brighter day\\. I got a text from my bishop today with the information to make the next steps towards getting a therapist\\. So hopefully I’ll be able to get that done tomorrow\\. You know, sometimes I imagine all of my pain and stress going away when you get back, but obviously that won’t be the case\\. I’ll still be in a really hard program and you will be, too, so we’ll have to work really hard just to have time together\\. But I still do think it’ll be awesome\\. Because I’ll have a reminder every day of why I’m working so hard and why life is so good\\. You’re my favorite, Becca\\. I think about you a lot\\. And I hope you’re happy and well today\\. Because I miss you\\.",

What’s happening, babe? I missed you today. Do you want to hear something crazy that happened recently? Jack, a guy in my ward, and Grace, a girl in my ward, got engaged a few days ago. It’s kind of crazy since they’ve only been dating for like six weeks! Do you remember how you freaked out a little bit when I just told you that I would marry you at a month? Some people move super fast ;p. While we were talking about this whole thing as a friend group and I was just thinking to myself how grateful I am that we’ve dated for as long as we have! I think we’ve been able to learn a lot of things about each other that we wouldn’t have been able to if I had married you when I thought I was ready for it haha. Basically what I’m saying is that I love you and I’m super grateful that things have worked out the way they have, even though it’s hard. Sleep well babe. I miss you :)\"}]}",

It was really hard for him to say goodbye because the people in the office had become his family and he loved them\\. Change is so hard\\. At one point he was kind of having a panic attack and he called Holly to tell her that he couldn’t do it\\. But as soon as she answered the phone and greeted him you could see the calm wash over his face\\. She made him laugh and he remembered why he was going\\. It just warms my heart so much and it feels so real because I’ve been in that situation\\.

You Beccha even. I missed you today. I want to tell you about one of those times. I was watching the Office and specifically the episode where Michael leaves because he’s moving to Colorado with his fiancée, Holly. Holly had already left and Michael was going around saying goodbye to everyone on his last day. It was really hard for him to say goodbye because the people in the office had become his family and he loved them. Change is so hard. At one point he was kind of having a panic attack and he called Holly to tell her that he couldn’t do it. But as soon as she answered the phone and greeted him you could see the calm wash over his face. She made him laugh and he remembered why he was going. It just warms my heart so much and it feels so real because I’ve been in that situation. I’ve been freaking out but then had everything make sense and be okay when I talk to that person that my heart belongs to. Becca I’ve had more of those experiences with you than I ever had with anyone else! You help me to think clearly and know that things are okay. I want to go on all of life’s adventures with you by my side! It wouldn’t be anywhere near as fun without you :). Love you, Babe! Please sleep well. I miss you!\"}]}"

We could have ended the day with a nice long talk and a cuddle session on the couch! Sounds pretty perfect, right?? Well let’s do it when you get back :). Love you! Sleep well. I miss you!\"}]}",

I like to think that you would have enjoyed doing those things with me :\\)\\. At one point we were talking about how nice it is being in love\\. I was able to think back to all of the fun we were able to have and how every moment together is just so calming and nice\\. I miss those times with you but I really look forward to making lots of those memories\\. We can explore everywhere together and have the time of our lives\\!

Do you know what I thought about today? How we used to dance together! A couple of specific memories come to mind. The first is when we went swing dancing together right at the beginning of knowing each other. I thought you were hitting on me but it turns out you were just being nice or something ;p. I think it’s funny that neither of us really had any interest in continuing to go to that once we starting dating haha. Another time that stands out is when we found a random room in the Wilk and put on music over the speakers. It was so much fun just having all of the space to dance around! Then I think about the times we would slow dance in your living room and how much fun that was. I love being close to you and singing our songs with you :). And then last but not least I thought about the last time that we danced together. It was on our last night and just a few hours before I left you for eighteen months. It was such an emotional time but it was so nice to take that time to just be together. I look forward to lots of future times where we can dance again. I’ll make sure to step on your foot so you know you’re not dreaming ;p. Love you, babe! Be well! I miss you. \"}]}",

      "text" : "Sho sho sho, babe\\! Do you know what I thought about today? How we used to dance together\\! A couple of specific memories come to mind\\. The first is when we went swing dancing together right at the beginning of knowing each other\\. I thought you were hitting on me but it turns out you were just being nice or something ;p\\. I think it’s funny that neither of us really had any interest in continuing to go to that once we starting dating haha\\. Another time that stands out is when we found a random room in the Wilk and put on music over the speakers\\. It was so much fun just having all of the space to dance around\\! Then I think about the times we would slow dance in your living room and how much fun that was\\. I love being close to you and singing our songs with you :\\)\\. And then last but not least I thought about the last time that we danced together\\. It was on our last night and just a few hours before I left you for eighteen months\\. It was such an emotional time but it was so nice to take that time to just be together\\. I look forward to lots of future times where we can dance again\\. I’ll make sure to step on your foot so you know you’re not dreaming ;p\\. Love you, babe\\! Be well\\! I miss you\\.",
